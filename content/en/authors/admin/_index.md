I am currently enrolled in the Department of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at Jeonbuk National University, with a deep interest in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in machine learning and computer vision (CV) technologies. I am captivated by the allure of computer vision, which involves analyzing image and video data to discover new possibilities.

I aim to explore the process of enabling computers to learn and evolve autonomously by applying machine learning algorithms, thereby uncovering the technological potential to solve various problems. In the future, I plan to conduct in-depth research in this field and pursue academic achievements through graduate studies, while also actively engaging in AI-related development projects.
